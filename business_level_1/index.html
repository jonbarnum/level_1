        <p id="comeAlong">"Come along with me
            And the butterflies and bees
            We can wander through the forest
            And do so as we please
            Come along with me
            To a cliff under a tree
            Where we can gaze upon the water
            As an everlasting dream
            All of my collections
            I'll share them all with you
            Maybe by next summer
            We won't have changed our tunes
            We'll still want to be
            With the butterflies and bees
            Making up new numbers
            And living so merrily
            All of my collections
            I'll share them all with you
            I'll be here for you always
            And always be with you
            Come along with me
            And the butterflies and bees
            We can wander through the forest
            And do so as we please
            Living so merrily"</p>
